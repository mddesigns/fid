<h2 id="startT">Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.</li>

<li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture.</li>

<li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="startg">Garlic  Salmon</h2>

<p>This is one of my favorite recipes for when folks come over for dinner. I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's <em>so easy</em> to make!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>
  <li>2 T. soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>
  <li>2 t. dry mustard</li>
  <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>
  <li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece as well.)</li>
  <li>Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking (I like it still pink in the center).</li>
  <li>I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="startl">Linguine with Clam Sauce</h2>

<p>I don't know how authentic this recipe is, but it's quick and delicious. You can make it lactose-free by substituting a dairy-free margarine (we like Earth's Balance) for the butter. (Unfortunately, butter is better.) This recipe serves 2.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cans chopped clams (tuna-sized cans)</li>
  <li>1/2 head of garlic, chopped fine</li>
  <li>1 shallot, chopped fine</li>
  <li>2-3 T. butter (or margarine)</li>
  <li>1/2-3/4 c. dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc)</li>
  <li>1/2 lb. linguine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Get the water boiling for the linguine. Generously salt the water so the pasta has flavor of its own.</li>
  <li> Open the cans of clams and use the lid to squeeze out the liquid into a 2-cup measuring cup. Set the clams aside You usually get about 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Add wine to the liquid until you have a total of 2 cups liquid.</li>
  <li> In a high-sided, large skillet, saute the shallot in 2 T. butter until translucent. Add the garlic (the more the better) and saute until fragrant, but not brown (just under a minute).</li>
  <li> Add the clam juice and wine to the shallots and garlic. Turn the heat to medium high until the mixture boils. Continue boiling until the liquid has reduced by half.</li>
  <li> Turn down the heat and add the reserved clams. At roughly the same time, add the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. About 9 minutes later, the pasta should be done and the clams will be warmed through.</li>
  <li> Taste the clam sauce and add salt and pepper to taste. If you're using butter, add one last tablespoon or two to bind the sauce (if you're using margarine, don't bother).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="startc">Couscous Salad with Peas and Mint</h2>

<p>This is barely a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; since I just threw it together and didn't pay much attention to measurements. But it turned out to be pretty tasty, so I thought I'd share. It's not the kind of thing where exact measurements are that crucial anyway, so use your best judgment and personal taste.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 package couscous </li>
  <li>1 can chicken broth (or water or veggie broth if you're vegetarian)</li>
  <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups fresh peas, shelled</li>
  <li>3-4 scallions, sliced thin</li>
  <li>1/4 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
  <li>about 1/2 cup fresh mint, chopped (it's gotta be fresh, not dried)</li>
  <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
  <li>approx. 1/4 cup olive oil (or to taste)</li>
  <li>1 t. salt</li>
  <li>fresh ground pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Make whole box of couscous according to the directions, only use chicken broth instead of water. A typical can of broth will be just short of the amount of liquid it calls for on the box, so top it off with water. It will be done in 6 or 7 minutes. Allow to cool (putting it in the fridge speeds it up).</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, toss the shelled fresh peas into a pot of boiling water and cook them about 3 minutes, until bright green and tender, but not mushy. Test after 2 minutes to make sure they're not overcooked. Rinse in cold water and allow to cool.</li>
  <li>Slice the scallions, chop the mint, toast the pinenuts, and prepare any other veggies you want to toss in there.</li>
  <li>Make the dressing in a small bowl by whisking together the juice of a lemon, the salt, pepper, and enough olive oil to properly balance the acidity of the lemon juice. It will take approximately 1/4 cup of olive oil, maybe a little more. Remember that this dressing has to flavor many cups of bland and absorbant couscous, so make sure you have enough and make sure the flavor is bold (don't be afraid of the salt... it will get spread out).</li>
  <li>When the couscous is cool, toss in the peas, mint, veggies and coat with the dressing. It can be served right away or saved until the next day.</li>
